# test-canvas

Boilerplate code for the great [text-canvas](https://github.com/heremaps/harp.gl/tree/master/%40here/harp-text-canvas) library by [Here technologies](here.com) for the open-source [harp.gl](harp.gl) map rendering engine. This library implements advanced SDF text in a webgl context with multi-lingual support and advanced memory optimizations for large sets of characters (chinese, hindu, arabic...) needed for map rendering.

This repo copies the [harp.gl example for text-canvas](https://www.harp.gl/docs/master/examples/#textcanvas.html) but as a standalone to illustrate how to deal with the associated package [heremaps/harp-fontcatalog](https://github.com/heremaps/harp-fontcatalog).

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Astrak/text-canvas
yarn
yarn start
```
